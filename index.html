                        I'm a dedicated and detail-oriented software developer with a strong foundation in web 
                        development. I routinely solve LeetCode and write testcases with Golang. I have a solid 
                        understanding of Test-Driven and Behavior-Driven Development, along with the DevOps, 
                        Agile, and Scrum methodologies. In the early stages of my software development training,
                         I've built scalable backend applications, prototyping with Python using the Flask and 
                         Django frameworks. I've built frontend apps using React. I've also created and managed 
                         CI/CD pipelines using Tekton, learned to use git for version control, created CRUD APIs
                          with MongoDB, and deployed containerized applications to IBM Cloud Container Registry,
                           using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift.

                                        I created a 'Go Fundamentals' repository to continue to learn Go and Test-Driven 
                                        Development with 'quii/learn-go-with-tests' course. I've practiced many of the
                                        Golang fundamentals and iterated on my knowledge of TDD while studying the assignments. 
                                        At the completion of this course, I have now become familiar with Go syntax, Go's 
                                        concurrency abilities, the concept of Go routines with channels, and how to use 
                                        the Go testing package in order to create several implementations of testing 
                                        components such as Benchmarks, Examples, Fuzzing, Mocking, & a number of other 
                                        useful TDD practices to create effective testing strategies.

                                        I created a desktop-only medical appointment booking website called Stay Healthy, to provide
                                        access to medical care in remote areas. This desktop website is designed to allow patients
                                        to schedule appointments with healthcare providers easily. The platform enables users
                                        to view available slots, select providers, manage their appointments through their online
                                        accounts, and give feedback to the doctors about their care. Built using the React
                                        framework, this project initially relied on a pre-existing back end, which I later
                                        restructured using Vite. Throughout the development process, I've gained hands-on experience
                                        with Linux commands, JSX, and React. I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS
                                        with Bootstrap, Docker, using Git & GitHub, and creating UI/UX designs, both with Figma
                                        in theory and in practice.

                                        I built an Accounts microservice to manage customer data for an e-commerce platform,
                                        applying Test-Driven and Behavior-Driven Development. Using Flask and a Tekton pipeline, I
                                        automated workflows while structuring development via a Kanban board and milestone-based sprints.
                                        The service features a PostgreSQL database with RESTful APIs for CRUD and list operations,
                                        achieving 95% code coverage using Factory Boy and Unittest. Following the Model-View-Controller
                                        pattern, I ensured a clear separation of concerns between business logic and routing. The project
                                        includes a Dockerfile, CI/CD pipeline, and was deployed to IBM Registry, demonstrating my ability
                                        to develop scalable, well-tested microservices.

                                        I created a Django-based web app designed to serve as the main website for a
                                        band that integrates with the Pictures and Songs services from the two other IBM Backend
                                        Capstone Projects. This app features dynamic web pages, including a home page, a songs
                                        page listing all song titles, and a photos page displaying images from past events. It
                                        incorporates user authentication, allowing users to log in and access personalized features,
                                        while admins have the ability to create, edit, and delete concerts. The project
                                        involves data modeling using Django models and migrations to establish tables and relationships,
                                        along with the implementation of business logic through controllers that manage interactions
                                        between data models and templates. Finally, this app was then deployed on IBM Kubernetes
                                        Services during the final phase of the Capstone Project.

                                        I developed a Flask-based web service for retrieving song data, integrating MongoDB for efficient
                                        storage and retrieval. Deployed on IBM Code Engine using IBM Cloud, the service provides a RESTful API

                                        NoSQL databases, datastore architectures, and MongoDB’s features. I also performed CRUD operations via
                                        the MongoDB shell, connected Flask with MongoDB using Python SDKs, and built a scalable web service.
                                        This project strengthened my understanding of NoSQL databases and their role in robust application
