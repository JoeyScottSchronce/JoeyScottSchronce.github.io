Hi, thanks for visiting!

I’m a dedicated and detail-oriented software developer with a strong foundation in web development and software engineering. I have experience in building scalable backend applications using Python with the Flask and Django frameworks, as well as frontend development with JavaScript using the React and Vite frameworks. I am proficient in creating and managing CI/CD pipelines using Tekton, and deploying containerized applications to IBM Cloud Container Registry, using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift. I’ve also been taught how to use version control with Git/GitHub, cloud-native technologies, and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB. I have a solid understanding of Test-Driven and Behavior-Driven Development, along with the DevOps, Agile, and Scrum methodologies.
