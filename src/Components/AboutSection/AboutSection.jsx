                    I'm in the process of developing a strong foundation in Web Development and Software Engineering. I am excited to
                    embark on a fulfilling journey where I can continuously learn and grow while making meaningful contributions. I am
                    seeking an entry-level position in one of these fields and I'm eager to apply my growing knowledge and skills to
                    begin my new career.
